# Cellulite (General Purpose Cellular Automata)
Cellulite is intended to be a library providing generalized cellular automaton functionality 
for a variety of purposes.  In particular, it's meant to work with non-numeric cell values, 
and offers an Automaton class that can be extended to more restricted types of automata 
(e.g. lifelike automata or elmentary automata).

## API and Other Documentation
Currently, the only documentation available is the JSDoc documentation located in
the `docs` folder.

## Current Features
Automaton class allows basic functionality of initializing and running an automaton.

## Possible Future Work
- Implement subclasses for lifelike automata and elementary cellular automata
- Tutorials and examples of interesting uses
- Use Browserify to make library browser-friendly
- Tools for rendering as images or via HTML5 canvas
- Functionality facilitating increased interactivity (e.g. mouse clicks when in the browser)
- Command line tools for development and experimentation

I'll probably release this under the LGPL at some point, but for now consider it copyrighted.
