# Cellulite - The General-Purpose Cellular Automaton Library
Cellulite is intended to be a library providing generalized cellular automaton functionality for a variety of purposes on either the servier or client side.

Libraries for simulating cellular automata already exist, in NPM and elswehere, but my hope is that this one will provide more widely applicable functionality (including non-numeric values and tools for interaction via a canvas) that other libraries do not provide.

## Current Features
Nothing.  I haven't started writing yet.

## Planned Features
- Lifelike cellular automata
- Elementary cellular automata
- Generalized support for real-valued 2d automata
- Generalized support for other (i.e. object-valued) 2d automata
- Tools for rendering as images or via the canvas
- Tools allowing interaction via key & mouse clicks in the browser
- Intuitive command line tools for development on the server side.
- Example code showing more varied applications than typical.

## Copyright Info
I'll probably release this under the LGPL at some point, but for now consider it copyrighted.
